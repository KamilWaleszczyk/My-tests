# Portfolio
My Tester's Portfolio

At this place I would like to show how I test applications.
For this I will use the application "ToDoApp", which I created in order to learn new technologies. This is a mobile application for android.

I use the **Jira** platform with **xray** test manager

# How I test applications

Each bug is described and added to the sprint
